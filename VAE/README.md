## Traditional probabilistic model training method 
1) MLE  
  If set X is given like X = {x1, x2, ..., xn}, we can define P(X) which probability that X will be extracted is max.  
  We make P(X) by using neural network and, define that weight 'W', we can write it as P(X|W).  
  W is calculated by using
