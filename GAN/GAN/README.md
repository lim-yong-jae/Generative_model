# Summary
"Generator" generate fake image and, Discriminator judge that image is real or fake. For training Discriminator, we should use real image for teaching what is real. 
JS divergence is used to loss function. Paper use that metric function for judging two probability distribution is close or not.  

# Loss function 



# Result
 src folder's main.py is to load weight and make fake mnist image.  
 src folder's train.py is to train weight and save weight info to gen_weight_data.pt and, dis_weight_data.pt 
 
 <p align="center"> <img src="./img1/gan_result.png" alt="MLE" width="80%" height="80%"/> </p>
 I can get this result from main.py
